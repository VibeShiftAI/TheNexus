# Binding constraints (verbatim from the task brief, 762637e6-d2b9-4612-8878-7eb026931c48)

#### BC-WORKSPACE — Do the work inside /Volumes/Projects/TheNexus — QA's primary diff comes from there; any additional repo you touch must be named in your completion report.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** The assigned workspace must be the repo that holds the main body of the code this task changes. Check that before your first edit, not after.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Praxis, via the task re-point endpoint — POST /api/tasks/762637e6-d2b9-4612-8878-7eb026931c48/workspace with the new path and a reason. Robert, if the re-point is refused.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If the WHOLE task belongs elsewhere, re-point the task first and then do ALL the work in the new directory; if you only realise at the end, still call the endpoint with "baseline":"head". If the task merely also needs another repo, work there and declare it in your report. If neither is possible, report needs_input.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA builds the authoritative diff from this workspace and the dispatch-time snapshot, plus the diff of every additional repo the run touched and declared. Work done in an undeclared repo that Praxis could not record is invisible to review, and a round with no work in any visible repo fails as an empty diff no matter how correct the change is.

#### BC-CRITERIA — Satisfy every acceptance criterion above and cite the command or observation that proves each one.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Each criterion has to be verified against real behavior before you report complete — a criterion you did not run is a criterion you did not meet.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** The QA reviewer rules on a criterion you can show is defective; Robert's operator rulings override both. Neither happens silently — you have to raise it.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If a criterion cannot be met as written, say so explicitly with evidence and deliver everything else in full. Narrowing the scope quietly is not the fallback.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA scores each criterion mechanically against your diff. An unproven criterion is a fail verdict and a correction round, not a note.

#### BC-FOREIGN-WORK — The workspace is SHARED and may hold unrelated uncommitted work from other agents or Robert's own sessions. Never revert, stash, `git checkout`/`git restore`, or delete anything you did not change in this run.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Know what was already dirty before you touch the tree: the brief's workspace pre-flight lists it, and `git status` shows the rest. Anything on that list is somebody else's in-flight work.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Robert alone. No task brief, no reviewer finding, and no cleanup instinct authorizes discarding another session's changes.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** Work additively. Re-read a contended file immediately before each edit, keep your change narrow, and say in your walkthrough that the file was already dirty. Never `git add -A` or `git commit -a`.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** Git keeps no reflog for working-tree reverts, so the other session's work is gone unrecoverably — that happened on 2026-07-09 and cost a verified-but-uncommitted change.

#### BC-NO-COMMIT — Do NOT commit or push unless the task explicitly says to.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** A commit needs explicit authorization in this task's own brief. Absent that sentence, the work stays uncommitted.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Robert, through the end-of-day commit-approval workflow. The task brief itself, when it explicitly instructs you to commit.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** Leave the change in the working tree; `git add` only the NEW files you created if the task needs them visible to review.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA reviews your UNCOMMITTED diff against a dispatch-time snapshot. Committing moves the work out of that view, and the round can read as an empty diff — a mandatory fail — even though the code is right.

#### BC-LIFECYCLE — Do NOT change this task's status in The Nexus yourself.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** The completion protocol markers at the end of this brief are the only status channel available to you; use them instead of the board.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Praxis's completion handler owns the lifecycle. Robert can override it from the board.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** End with the exact completion / failure / needs-input protocol, and put anything the status cannot express into the walkthrough.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** A hand-edited status desynchronizes the schedule from the run, and the executor callback that would have carried your result is discarded.

#### BC-QUALITY-GATES — Run BOTH quality gates — verify and code-review — and declare them on the marker line before reporting complete.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** The verify pass needs the change actually exercised (run the flow, command, or test — a typecheck is not a verify), and the code-review pass needs your own uncommitted diff re-read end to end.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Nobody. Neither an executor nor a reviewer may waive a gate; the only sanctioned exception is a change with no runtime surface, and you must say that explicitly on the marker line.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If there is genuinely nothing to drive, declare that in place of a command rather than omitting the gate or inventing a command you did not run.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** A completion reported without the marker line is treated as unverified work and flagged for the human reviewer, whatever the walkthrough claims.

#### BC-WORKSPACE-BINDING — Your home workspace is `/Volumes/Projects/TheNexus`. You MAY work in additional repos under /Volumes/Projects when the task genuinely needs it, and you MUST name every extra repo you touched — absolute path — and why, in your completion report.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Before writing outside the home workspace, know that the task genuinely needs that repo. Praxis records every write outside the home root, so the record and your report have to agree.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** You, by declaring it in the completion report — that is the sanctioned way to widen the task's footprint. If the WHOLE task belongs in a different repo, re-point it through the workspace endpoint instead so QA's primary diff moves with you.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If you touched a repo you did not need, say so in the report anyway (an honest extra repo is not a defect); if you cannot tell which repos you touched, list every one you might have.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA collects the diff from every repo you touched and judges it on merit — it never fails you merely for editing another repo. An UNDECLARED extra repo (recorded by Praxis, never named in your report) is the one cross-repo defect QA may raise.
