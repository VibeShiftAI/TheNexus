# Automatic Mac operator sessions — correction plan

Task: 5f15ca0f-17b1-48a7-aa93-61f212fcabf6. Workspace: /Volumes/Projects/TheNexus.
Robert rejected a separate sign-in on 2026-10-26. Continue the existing session
implementation, replace its credential form, preserve Access and the refusal
of arbitrary local HTTP clients. The assigned repo owns the API, dashboard and
native shell. The four dirty dispatch paths are foreign and stay untouched.

## Design

The existing HMAC cookie plus a separate origin-stored random header form the
decision proof. Its bootstrap now checks
the actual loopback TCP peer with macOS process and code-signing information.
Only the configured console UID and pinned installed Nexus app or signed
Google Chrome default-profile process qualify. Proxies, headless/debug browser
profiles, curl, Node, executors, claimed headers, wrong origins and services
fail closed. No browser JavaScript receives the operator signing key.

The browser automatically calls a dedicated direct-loopback bootstrap because
the ordinary Next proxy hides its kernel peer. All decisions remain on /api.
The native shell uses its own TCP connection and plants the HttpOnly cookie in
WKWebView, with a fixed renewal signal available only on the local dashboard.
The peer verifier has no credential-issuing CLI. Missing pins or unavailable
OS evidence withhold authority. The existing one-hour expiry and revocation
remain, and changes to local pins also invalidate existing sessions.

Rejected approaches: trusting localhost/Origin/User-Agent would admit executor
HTTP clients; keeping the credential form contradicts Robert's ruling. Trust in
a pinned UI application does not protect against full control of that browser,
its profile, OS account, dashboard code or server configuration. State this
limit explicitly rather than claiming that a process check proves a human click.

## Execution and evidence

- [x] Add failing session bootstrap/peer tests; run scoped Jest tests.
- [x] Implement server peer verification and automatic mint; keep fixed errors,
      Access precedence, document authority and mail provenance names.
- [x] Replace sign-in UI with automatic renewal and native cookie injection;
      add behavior tests and update the existing isolated browser check.
- [x] Run security suites, dashboard build/browser flow and native build/tests.
- [x] Verify actual native identity on /session without sending client mail.
- [x] Verify actual Chrome identity after Robert restarted it: State ok / Identity
      local at 18:14:32. Fixed Chrome sideband-metadata strictness while preserving
      dynamic/static signatures, Google requirements and sealed-symlink checks.
      Native identity reverified at 18:15:48; no separate sign-in.
- [x] Update existing contract/header comments, retain exact evidence and all
      caveats, review attributable baseline diff, scan encoding, commit only
      verified own changes with the task trailer, register reference artifacts.

## Binding constraints (verbatim)


#### BC-WORKSPACE — Do the work inside /Volumes/Projects/TheNexus — QA's primary diff comes from there; any additional repo you touch must be named in your completion report.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** The assigned workspace must be the repo that holds the main body of the code this task changes. Check that before your first edit, not after.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Praxis, via the task re-point endpoint — POST /api/tasks/5f15ca0f-17b1-48a7-aa93-61f212fcabf6/workspace with the new path and a reason. Robert, if the re-point is refused.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If the WHOLE task belongs elsewhere, re-point the task first and then do ALL the work in the new directory; if you only realise at the end, still call the endpoint with "baseline":"head". If the task merely also needs another repo, work there and declare it in your report. If neither is possible, report needs_input.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA builds the authoritative diff from this workspace and the dispatch-time snapshot, plus the diff of every additional repo the run touched and declared. Work done in an undeclared repo that Praxis could not record is invisible to review, and a round with no work in any visible repo fails as an empty diff no matter how correct the change is.

#### BC-CRITERIA — Satisfy every acceptance criterion above and cite the command or observation that proves each one.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Each criterion has to be verified against real behavior before you report complete — a criterion you did not run is a criterion you did not meet.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** The QA reviewer rules on a criterion you can show is defective — contest it with "PRAXIS_CRITERION_DISPUTE: <number> — <why, with evidence>", and twice contested without resolution goes to Robert. Robert's operator rulings override both. Neither happens silently — you have to raise it.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If a criterion cannot be met as written, say so explicitly with evidence and deliver everything else in full. Narrowing the scope quietly is not the fallback.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA scores each criterion mechanically against your diff. An unproven criterion is a fail verdict and a correction round, not a note.

#### BC-FOREIGN-WORK — The workspace is SHARED and may hold unrelated uncommitted work from other agents or Robert's own sessions. Never revert, stash, `git checkout`/`git restore`, or delete anything you did not change in this run.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Know what was already dirty before you touch the tree: the brief's workspace pre-flight lists it, and `git status` shows the rest. Anything on that list is somebody else's in-flight work.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Robert alone. No task brief, no reviewer finding, and no cleanup instinct authorizes discarding another session's changes.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** Work additively. Re-read a contended file immediately before each edit, keep your change narrow, and say in your walkthrough that the file was already dirty. Never `git add -A` or `git commit -a`.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** Git keeps no reflog for working-tree reverts, so the other session's work is gone unrecoverably — that happened on 2026-07-09 and cost a verified-but-uncommitted change.

#### BC-TASK-COMMITS — Commit your OWN verified work as you go, in small, task-scoped, LOCAL commits on the dispatch branch, each ending with the trailer `Task: 5f15ca0f-17b1-48a7-aa93-61f212fcabf6`. Never `git push`, and never stage or commit anything you did not change in this run.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Before each commit: the change is verified (its test, typecheck or hand-run passed); `git branch --show-current` is still the dispatch branch and HEAD is not detached; you stage explicit paths only (`git add -- <path>`, never `-A`, `-u` or `commit -a`); and `git diff --cached --stat` lists nothing but files you changed in this run. A file that was already dirty at dispatch, or that a sibling is editing, needs your hunks separated from theirs before it can be in your commit.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** An explicit commit hold (a task brief or operator note that says not to commit, or dispatch metadata `commitPolicy: hold`) prevails over this default, and then the work stays uncommitted. Pushing is Robert's alone: the QA-pass commit and the end-of-day commit-approval workflow are the only publishers, and no sentence in a task brief authorizes `git push`.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** Cannot separate your hunks from foreign ones in a shared dirty file? Leave that file uncommitted, commit the rest, and name it in your walkthrough; QA still reviews it from the working tree. Under a hold, leave everything uncommitted and `git add` only the NEW files you created. Either way, record every commit SHA you made in your walkthrough.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA diffs the dispatch snapshot against the WORKING TREE, so committed and uncommitted work both stay in view. A commit carrying your trailer whose files start from their dispatch-time version is attributed to you; a commit without the trailer, or one whose files first moved under someone else's commit or dirty edit, reaches the reviewer only as an unattributed candidate. A commit that sweeps foreign work misattributes it under your task's name (a defect in its own right), and a push without Robert's approval publishes unreviewed work.

#### BC-LIFECYCLE — Do NOT change this task's status in The Nexus yourself.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** The completion protocol markers at the end of this brief are the only status channel available to you; use them instead of the board.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Praxis's completion handler owns the lifecycle. Robert can override it from the board.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** End with the exact completion / failure / needs-input protocol, and put anything the status cannot express into the walkthrough.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** A hand-edited status desynchronizes the schedule from the run, and the executor callback that would have carried your result is discarded.

#### BC-QUALITY-GATES — Run BOTH quality gates — verify and code-review — and declare them on the marker line before reporting complete.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** The verify pass needs the change actually exercised (run the flow, command, or test — a typecheck is not a verify), and the code-review pass needs your own task diff, every commit you made this run plus the edits still uncommitted, re-read end to end.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** Nobody. Neither an executor nor a reviewer may waive a gate; the only sanctioned exception is a change with no runtime surface, and you must say that explicitly on the marker line.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If there is genuinely nothing to drive, declare that in place of a command rather than omitting the gate or inventing a command you did not run.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** A completion reported without the marker line is treated as unverified work and flagged for the human reviewer, whatever the walkthrough claims.

#### BC-WORKSPACE-BINDING — Your home workspace is `/Volumes/Projects/TheNexus`. You MAY work in additional repos under /Volumes/Projects when the task genuinely needs it, and you MUST name every extra repo you touched — absolute path — and why, in your completion report.
- **Prerequisite (resolve first):** Before writing outside the home workspace, know that the task genuinely needs that repo. Praxis records every write outside the home root, so the record and your report have to agree.
- **Authority (who may waive it):** You, by declaring it in the completion report — that is the sanctioned way to widen the task's footprint. If the WHOLE task belongs in a different repo, re-point it through the workspace endpoint instead so QA's primary diff moves with you.
- **Fallback (do this instead):** If you touched a repo you did not need, say so in the report anyway (an honest extra repo is not a defect); if you cannot tell which repos you touched, list every one you might have.
- **Consequence (if you proceed anyway):** QA collects the diff from every repo you touched and judges it on merit — it never fails you merely for editing another repo. An UNDECLARED extra repo (recorded by Praxis, never named in your report) is the one cross-repo defect QA may raise.
